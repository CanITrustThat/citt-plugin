# Changelog

## 2.0.0

- Rewritten for the CanITrustThat research API (`/api/research/v1`): scans by a versioned rule pack with findings, evidence, facts and a compliance status per regime.
- Every account can use the plugin. A Pay as you go account scans one Android app at a time (`citt submit PACKAGE`) and asks questions about an app (`citt prompt`); projects, CSV submits, findings across a project, scrutiny, exports, owners and iOS scans are on the Researcher, Deep Researcher and Custom plans.
- New commands: `projects`, `status`, `apps`, `app`, `findings`, `scrutinize`, `prompt`, `export-results`, `export-sources`, `owners`, `usage`.
- Removed: the 0.4 commands `search`, `results`, `claim`, `mine`, `report`, `scan`, `result` and `rescan`, whose routes were retired in October 2026. A question about one app is `citt prompt`; a rescan is `citt submit --rescan` in a project.
- Codex: the same repository is a Codex plugin marketplace (`codex plugin marketplace add CanITrustThat/citt-plugin`).
- The token stored by 0.4 is used as is.
